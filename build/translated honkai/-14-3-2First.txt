()||<BIN>85</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:[The battle ends, and the doll echelons successfully(?) reach the target base.+With PP90 and Vector’s help, Kiana also reaches the base.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:We… we made it at last.+I thought the Slain would get us a few times, it scared me so much I thought my pulse module would pop out...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I have to give it full marks for entertainment value. That was a breathtaking performance.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Oi! Are you unhappy with my leadership or something!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Ah, no! We wouldn’t have made it out of there if not for you, Kiana-san!+I’ll go to the comms equipment to contact the Commander. You guys go rest first.

PP90(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Beep.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Commander! Can you hear me? It’s me, your adjutant PP90!
PP90(0)<Speaker>Girl's Voice（?）</Speaker>||:Ah, I hear you. Come to think of it… you really are loud...
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:What? Your commander’s a girl too?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Wait, that’s not the Commander, it’s…+Who is it, anyway?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hey! FN57! What are you doing here!?
PP90(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN57</Speaker><通讯框>||:Ah, sorry, since these are special circumstances… to cut a long story short, you’re under me for the time being.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:W-what?
PP90(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN57</Speaker>||:I’m sorry, but you just escaped, right? I don’t know how you did it, but you were really lucky.+However, we are desperately short on manpower, so I apologize for this.+Also, my orders are specially sanctioned by the people up top. I’ve already sent you the proof.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:But we just made it out of there with our lives and there’s hordes of zombies out there! And now you want us to go back out there again?+Where’s the Commander!? Please let me speak to the Commander!
PP90(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN57</Speaker>||:Your Commander has been temporarily barred from involvement in this matter, since it might lead to an irrevocable situation.+I’m sorry, but I’m serious, despite how I look.+In any case, you have no choice. Your forces will now obey my orders, and there is an objective I need you to take care of.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:…………+Do you have a command module? Can you direct all of us?
PP90(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN57</Speaker>||:I do, though not of a very high grade…+The situation is urgent, so there’s no other options. I’ll command as many people as I can.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:…I understand.+We’ll carry out operations as ordered.+However, please allow us command authority over ourselves. We have a more suitable commander candidate.
PP90(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN57</Speaker>||:What? There’s actually a better person for the job than me?+That’s perfect! FAL and I have our hands full over here.+Listen, there’s a human of unknown origin who’s illegally trespassed into a restricted area run by Griffin.+This area is near your forces. Fortunately those zombie hordes stopped her, so she’s wandering around the sector entrance now.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:A human? Trespassing?
PP90(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN57</Speaker>||:That’s right. The matter is extremely urgent. Please consider this mission to be your highest priority. Drive her away immediately and do your best to subdue her without hurting her.+Your opposition seems to be very powerful and the zombie hordes aren’t much of a threat to her. Try your best not to anger her, but the use of force is permitted if necessary.+I’ve already sent over the target’s description. Report back if anything happens. *quietly* God dammit, I’m going to be worked to death over here… first Kar-san goes missing and now I have to research Breakdown detection...
PP90(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[FN57 ends the transmission.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:What the heck… is all this…+*sighs* Well, in any case, all we can do is grin and bear it.+Still, if FN57-san showed up, that means...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:PP90, is that petite human the target we have to chase away?
Theresa(0)<Speaker></Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:[Vector points to the electronic image of the white-haired girl on the monitor.]
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||: Mm… I guess?+Still… is she a child?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hmph, the incident which triggered the last world war began at the hands of several children…+Kiana-san, what’s the matter?
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:…+No, no way… is that… Headmistress Theresa?
