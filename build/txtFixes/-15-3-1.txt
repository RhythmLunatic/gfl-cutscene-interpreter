琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Like I was saying… You really shouldn’t have left Destroyer where she was, Bronya.+If we had captured her, we would have done a great deal to help Griffin.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Mei-nee said not to interfere too much with this world.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Fine, fine but what should we do now?+The Slain have all gone mad and they’re charging the base. I guess no good deed goes unpunished, especially by Destroyer!
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:That’s not the reason why. It should be the opposite.+After removing Destroyer’s Breakdown Energy, all the Slain have gone out of control.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Ahhhh honestly! And we don’t know where Vector and Seele have wandered to a time like this!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:According to my last position fix, they ought to be very close to the base.+Even so, we’ve got a large area to search.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:That’s fine. All we need to do is split up and look.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:A good plan, but not suitable for the present situation.+The Slain are flooding towards the base; going out alone is extremely dangerous.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Theresa-san, can you clear away the nearby Breakdown energy so the Slain will run out of steam by themselves?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Ah… fully cleansing the area isn’t easy. Seele and Vector might not be able to hold out that long.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Bronya can sneak in.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:It’s a whole new sector outside, and you don’t understand the terrain or the enemy’s disposition. Charging in recklessly is both risky and not likely to succeed.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Let me go. I used to patrol this region often and I know the lay of the land.+Vivi might be stuck in a place with impeded comms; that way I can contact them quickly.
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:But wouldn’t it be even more dangerous if PP90 went by herself?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:No. According to my investigations, these Slain dolls were produced by a SF plant, and without other orders, they react much more strongly to humans than dolls.+Also, an individual doll’s presence is much harder to detect than that of a human, so the Slain would have a harder time detecting them.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:But is there nothing we can do here?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:The Slain currently surround this base. If you can help Griffin defend this place, you’ll be doing everyone a big favor.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:You don’t have to worry about that. Kiana, you mustn’t let a single Slain get in here.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Even so, we’ll still need to help PP90 clear a path.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Got it. I’ll start by having the echelons open a safe route for PP90, and then PP90 will go search for Vector and Seele.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:That’s fine. Leave it to me.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Let us know if anything dangerous happens.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Do your best, Another Bronya.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Ahaha… I’ll work hard for you too, Bronya-san. Don’t worry!
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:Kiana, don’t forget to give PP90 support while she’s on her way.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||: Yup! And since I’ll pinpoint Vivi and Seele’s locations right away, don’t forget to place support for them in the vicinity!
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good, then let’s take our places, everyone!+All we need to do is hold the base and welcome Seele and Vector back, and then everything will be over!
