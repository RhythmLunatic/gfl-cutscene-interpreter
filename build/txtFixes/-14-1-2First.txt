Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I know, I know…+I know you don’t mean this… you don’t mean to crawl over, grab us, and chew at our heads and modules…+you don’t mean it, neither do I, nobody means to do any of this, right? So, who’s to blame?

Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Well, it doesn’t matter, you’re just dying in a different way…+Alright, that’s the last of the explosives. I don’t have any more regrets now.
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Crash! Bang!]+[The remaining zombie dolls flood towards the door and begin clawing at the bulletproof door.]+[Bang! Crash! Bang!]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:How much longer can this door hold?+If the building firm cut corners...
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Bang! Crash! Bang!]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:What a joke. I’m pinning my hopes on humans...

Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:For the time being. I might not be in the next couple of minutes.
Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hey! You said you’d tell me if you couldn’t hold out!

Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Well, I’m telling you now, aren’t I?
Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Vivi, you - ahhh, forget it!+The Commander’s broken through the zombie doll encirclement, everyone’s starting to retreat!+Vivi, get out of there and follow us!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oh, really?+I’m not a fan of plot developments like those, but maybe it’s not too bad today.
()||:[Vector puts her weapon away and prepares to unlock the safety tunnel behind her.]+[...zzz...zzz..]+[There is some static on the line.]
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Huh? Did you say something, Vivi?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Were you bothered by it? You don’t need to pretend, besides-
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:[...zzz...zzz…]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:? ...PP90?

Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Urgh… what’s that noise…!
()||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:[Vector opens her eyes and finds that the walls of the warehouse have been destroyed and the zombie dolls have surrounded her.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:........+PP, do you hear me?
()||:[There's no response, only the howling of the zombie dolls.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:In the end, I’m not even going to get a cliched ending like that...
()||:[The zombie dolls slowly close in, and with no way to retreat, Vector stands back up and relocks the safety door leading to the interior of the base.]+[And then, Vector puts her weapon down.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Still, this does suit me very well, dying in a corner without knowing what’s going on…+If I’d known this would happen...

Kiana(0)<Speaker>White-Haired Human Girl</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xBH2_Menu</BGM>:Hey, you alright?
Kiana(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[The white-haired human girl wipes out the surrounding zombie dolls in an instant with a powerful weapon, and then walks over.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I’m fine, are you alone?
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector approaches the girl.]
Kiana(0)<Speaker>White-Haired Human Girl</Speaker>||:Huh? Is that the first thing you’re going to say to someone who saved your life?+Granted, I am indeed alone...
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector raises her weapon and points it at her.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Your name.
Kiana(0)<Speaker>White-Haired Human Girl</Speaker>||:You!  What the hell are you doing!?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I repeat. Your name.
Kiana(0)<Speaker>White-Haired Human Girl</Speaker>||:Tch…Listen. First, if I had a mind to attack you, you’d be a goner for sure.+However, I’m not as unreasonable as you; I don’t point my gun at people without even a word of thanks...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thank you. Now hurry up and tell me your name.
Kiana(0)<Speaker>White-Haired Human Girl</Speaker>||:…I’m Kiana.
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Kiana Kaslana!+How about that, you happy now!? If you must know, I don’t just go around telling people my name!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Who sent you.
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey! I’m not your enemy! Otherwise why would I save you!?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:ou might be the mastermind behind these zombies, who saved me to win my trust and find some way to learn about Griffin.+While I’m not interested in currying favor with others, I’m still a doll who’s officially employed by Griffin, and I have to adhere to its confidentiality guidelines-
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Wait wait wait! What the hell are you rambling on by yourself about?+What’s all this about Griffin and dolls? You look so cute but you talk like a robot.+Also, they aren’t ordinary zombies, they’re the Slain!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:The "Slain"... ? What are those? Also, how do you know?
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:More importantly, do you hear that, the footsteps of the Slain?+The next wave of attacks is coming. You can follow me or stand here with that SMG of yours and wait to die. Take your pick.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……(Given the look in her eyes, she’s probably not lying.)
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey! What are you looking at!? We can talk once we get out of here!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:…I’ll believe you for now.+However, don’t expect anything out of me, whether it’s information or fighting power.+Go ahead and abandon me if you need to.
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:You really are a weird one…+Were you… modified or something?+You know, mentally… like my friend...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Ah, sorry for asking weird questions…+In any case, I just want to get out of here, I don’t want to know or take part in anything else.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Got it. Let’s go.

Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Also, Kiana Kaslana-san…+You’re mistaken. I am not human.
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Huh?
()||:[Vector stands in front of the door and turns around.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Allow me to briefly introduce myself. I am an IOP second-generation Tactical Doll, codenamed “Vector”.+Kiana-san, welcome to Griffin PMC. I apologize that I am the one to be welcoming you thus…+But 'needs must when the devil drives', so please bear with it.
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Tactical Doll? PMC?+Where… on earth am I...
