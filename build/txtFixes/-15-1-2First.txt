Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:Looks like your use of tactics has improved greatly, Kiana.+You might really be the hope of Destiny.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hehe, I haven’t gone all-out yet.+Also, it’s thanks to these dolls. They’re all so cute and they’re very obedient!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Commander Kiana, we’ve completed the preliminary work for the search, awaiting your orders!

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Has everyone received pictures of the targets? One of them is a black-haired girl called “Raiden Mei”, she looks kind and friendly.+The other is a gray-haired girl called Bronya, she looks… er, kind of like me…+Ahhh, quit laughing! Get a move on! First echelon, you head left, second, you go right, everyone else, go forward, and Vivi...
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Ah… that’s right, Vivi’s not here…+Forget it, then I’ll hold the rear. I need to share the work with Vivi from time to time.

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:*muttering to herself* I wonder what’s happened to Vivi. We agreed to check in regularly with each other, but she never called at all…+Why is that… after this operation is done, I need to call her right away and give her a good scolding…+No, I can’t be too fierce either, or else she’ll lose her temper...

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Uuu...

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:(Save me? Who’s going to save me?)
Vector(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:(Vivi… )+(No, not Vivi… I can’t let her see how useless I am now!)

琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Whew… fortunately comms with the other echelons weren’t jammed…+Honestly, you two… what kind of weird superhero movie were you acting out?+PP90…+And Mei-senpai.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xBH2_Menu</BGM>:Kiana…+That voice… Is that Kiana?+Kiana! Where are you!?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:I’m in a command room 15 km away, talking through you through the doll adjutant that you’re trampling underfoot.+Turns out… you nearly electrocuted her to death.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Doll… adjutant?+Huh? Your face…
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:(So this is Mei-san, huh…)+(She... doesn’t look kind at all…)
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Therefore… would you mind getting off my adjutant’s body?+PP90, are you alright? Can you hear me?
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:(Vivi… I survived…)+(Wonderful… looks like I’ll have an adventure to brag about to you as well…)
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:PP90? Hello, can you hear me?
芽衣()<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:She’s just grinning like an idiot…+Did I shock her stupid or something...?
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey! If you really broke her, you’re going to have to pay, senpai!
芽衣()<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:I. I’m sorry, I’ll think of something.+This… what… what on earth is this...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Everyone, put your weapons away, we’ve found our objective! Your first priority is to rescue PP90!

Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector raises her head and sees a gigantic airship in the distance.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Is that… the Hyperion? Its design is really overelaborate…+Humans always like such pointless things, always rushing to dress themselves up in order to make others happy...

Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Yes, I’m very busy… haha…+If I hadn’t found the mothership, I wouldn’t have known how to reject her…+Besides, she probably doesn’t care, it’s just a standard business greeting...
PP90(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That’s right… her passion, kindness and smile are just instinctive actions with broad applicability.+They’ve got nothing to do with me or what I’ve done…+She’s the same with our Commander, with Kiana, with Theresa and Himeko, as well as me…+She treats people she’s known for a long time the same as people she might not meet again after a few hours. She treats people from another world the same way that she treats me…+This incident brought me into her social circle.

Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Please take a look at this proof. Kiana-san gave it to me.
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Then… what about Bronya-nee?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Bronya…?+(Is that the girl with the same sundae hair as PP90?)+We haven’t found her yet, but your friends are doing their best to find her.
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:…+Can… Seele go and find her?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I’m sorry, but as an ordinary Tactical Doll, I suggest that staying in that airship would be safer.

Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Also! We managed to take down the SF base and found Mei-san!+She’s the first friend Kiana made! Apparently the two of them barely escaped with their lives from a zombie outbreak at school!

PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Oh… dolls really are wonderful, but good thing there’s no big problems!+Anyway, let’s leave that aside! I’ll introduce her to you again; this is Raiden Mei, my senior and my best friend!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Greetings, PP90-san.+I’m very sorry about what I did to you just now. I’ll do my best to make it up to you in future.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Sorry about that, PP90-san.+What happened just now, and what happened before that… was all Mei-senpai’s doing.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Uuu… how shall I say this, I didn’t quite know what was going on back then.+After being separated from everyone, the storm blew me to a base which looked like a modified city…+And then my powers went a bit out of control, and with the amplification of the storm, I ended up destroying everything around me.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Wow, so you were that amazing, Mei-san...
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hmph, she’s just bad at controlling her powers.+After that, Mei-senpai met Destroyer from SF, and she told her how to control Breakdown Energy!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Well… I was the one who wrecked their base, after all, so I felt that I had to do something…+And she was crying and crying and saying that she wouldn’t be able to explain this to her master, and she looked so pitiful...
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Ahhh! You’re always like that, Mei-senpai! You just can’t leave people in trouble alone! That’s why screwups like this happen!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:This was my first time here, and I didn’t know SF and Griffin were on opposite sides.+And Destroyer was really nice to me too, she gave me lots of stuff and treats…+Besides, she was very cute too. I don’t believe you wouldn’t have fallen for it in my place, Kiana.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Ha! That’s nothing, of course I wouldn’t befriend an enemy because they were cute!+Listen here, Mei-senpai, I’d never have fallen for Destroyer’s lies!+PP90 can be my witness!+Er… PP90?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Ah! Sorry, I was a little distracted…+Ah… well, in any case, it’s good that you managed to find your friend, Kiana-san.+Also, it seems we’ve figured out the source of SF’s power. This operation was very successful.
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Yes. Now only Bronya’s left, and the only threat to you now is Destroyer, am I right?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:I landed near Bronya when the storm blew me away, but I don’t remember what happened after that...
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:That brat… where on earth is she hiding…+Still, she should be alright by herself. In any case, let’s take care of Destroyer first! It’s time to strike back!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Are you sure? I don’t think Destroyer’s that unreasonable...
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Wake up, Mei-senpai!+She’s part of SF, an organization that opposes mankind. Everything she did was just to use you! She would never have truly regarded you as a friend!

BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Hmph, it wasn’t as hard as you said it would be, Mei-san.+As long as you offer your desires to the “will” of the Breakdown...
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Stop that, Destroyer-san! I told you before, you must never do that!+That will… That will only make you...
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Hmph, didn’t you do that yourself in the past?+If you could survive it, then… I can too!
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:I understand now…+So I really was deceived.+I want in on this battle no matter what!
