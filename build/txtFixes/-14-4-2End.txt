Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:…………+Alright, playtime’s over!
Theresa(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Theresa swiftly leaps out of the combat zone and puts her weapon away.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Huh? She stopped all of a sudden?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:She wasn’t using her full strength at all.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:What’s this, Headmistress? Are you testing us again?
Vector(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:That’s one part of it. At the very least, I’ve got a rough grasp of the combat methods of this world… they’re rather quaint.+As for the rest… well, I’ve finished investigating the Relic.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:What? But you were right here...
Vector(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, don’t you think it’s strange that I was standing at the entrance without going in?+Hello? My side’s settled, so report your status.
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_xBH2_Menu</BGM>:I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed, Headmistress.+The sealing technologies used underground are completely different from what we known, and we have no way of undoing them at present.+Also, the detailed scan reports that the energy inside is different from Breakdown Energy.
德丽莎()<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Is it? So this world has quite an incredible secret too…+Still, that’s quite a disappointing outcome. Let’s pack it up for today.
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Alright, then I’ll be coming up to the surface now...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That voice is…+Himeko-san? Is that Himeko-san!?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><黑屏2>:Ah, so it’s Kiana. Good to see you’re safe.+Hang on… what happened outside? Were you fighting?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Hehe, I was just testing the strength of Kiana’s new friends.+Alright, all the contradictions should be cleared up now, right? We’re Kiana’s superiors, so please show us a good time.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Huh? Oh… okay...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Why are things changing so quickly...
Vector(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:I can tell that you’re androids, so isn’t it only natural to be friendly to human beings?+What are you standing there for, won’t you invite us to your base for some tea?
Vector(0);Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Thank you, though beer would be better.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><黑屏2>:[Half an hour later, in the base.]
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2>:I see…+So your enemies… the mechanical insurgents called Sangvis Ferri, have mastered the ability to control the Slain?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Yes, but without us, this world can’t create Breakdown Energy so quickly.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:That would be tricky. One of us might have fallen into enemy hands.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:It’s either Bronya or Mei-senpai, though I doubt either of them would have gone willingly.+Wait a minute, it might be that… they’re being used.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:SF Ringleaders are quite cunning. We can’t eliminate that possibility. 
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You mean Destroyer did that? Are you sure?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Well, whatever it is, I think both we and Griffin have the same objective, right?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:I’ll ask FN57-san about it. It shouldn’t be a problem.
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:…………
PP90(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Alright. Once we deal with the enemy leader, we should be able to settle everything.+Kiana, we shouldn’t interfere with the matters of this world. We’ll be placing the rest of the operation in your hands, as their commander.+As for me, I’m going to walk around the Griffin base for a bit~
PP90(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Headmistress… you’re trying to learn more, aren’t you?
PP90(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Hehe, I’ve come all this way, I can’t just leave empty-handed!
Himeko(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Theresa(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:[Himeko enters the room]
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Bad news, Theresa. I can’t contact the Hyperion.
Himeko(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:That’s a bit troublesome. We won’t be able to go back like this, will we?+Still, it might just be comms disruption. Everything should be alright if somebody can pin down the coordinates.+So, who’ll go? Himeko, will you be heading out?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:I’m sorry, Headmistress, but after seeing your big brawl with Griffin, I think I need to accompany you. 
Himeko(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Can you consider sending Griffin’s products there? Provided you can trust a doll like me, of course.
Himeko(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Ohhh, can I really bother you with that? Then please do!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Vivi, are you sure you’re going by yourself? You won’t need other helpers?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Too many people will just get in the way, and working alone suits me just fine.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Thank you, Vector-san. Just use this sensor and head to the location I told you about, and then pinpoint the airship’s location based on its signal strength.+The airship in question is huge and it’s red and black in color, so you should be able to find it easily.
Himeko(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:So it’s a large ship painted red and black? Understood.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Also, there’s a girl called Seele in the airship. She’s very afraid of strangers, so please treat her nicely. Otherwise...
Himeko(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Otherwise?
Himeko(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Seele has a dangerous split persona inside her. While it’s largely under control, we can’t rule out the possibility that it might go berserk again.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Vivi, are you really sure you won’t frighten her? Why don’t you let me go instead...
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You’re the adjutant. Stay here and do what you’re good at.+It’s not my specialty, but I can put on a few business faces. In that case, I’ll go tidy some things up...
PP90(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector leaves.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Will Vivi really be alright?
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Don’t worry, PP90.+From what I’ve seen, Vector is a very thoughtful person, so thoughtful that she ends up being hypersensitive.+While saying so might seem a little brusque, perhaps she might be the best person to interact with Seele. 
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Is that so?+That’s wonderful… perhaps Vivi will make a friend that suits her.
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You’re her friend too, it’s just that she’s unwilling to say so.+Alright, enough chit chat, let’s get to work!+Our target is Intruder of SF! Let’s take out her Slain army and take back our friends!
