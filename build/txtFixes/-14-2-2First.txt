琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Whew… we made it out at last…+Though I have to say, your pathfinding technique is very good.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thank you. Otherwise I’d really be useless.

琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hmph, I was helping you all the while, otherwise I could have just fought my way over here by myself -+eh...

Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:What’s the matter?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Vector, are they… all Tactical Dolls?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...Need I say more?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<震屏>:Wow! They’re so cute!+I! Am I in Heaven? Vector go see that adjutant of yours no need to worry about me I’ll take care of myself!+Hello, everyone! I’m Kiana-
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:[Kiana heads toward the crowd of dolls.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...It’s quiet at last…+yes, as it should be...

PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Vivi!!+Uwah! You’re back at last, Vivi!
PP90(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[PP90 rushes over and hugs Vector.]
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Ah… that kind of hurts, could you please let go...
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Uuu! I’m sorry I’m sorry!+I was too worked up, it’s wonderful to be able to see you again!
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Your reaction is too exaggerated and completely wasted on me.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:But you stayed there all by yourself to save us...
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I was just following orders, just like you did.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Ahhhhhh!
PP90(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Vector(0)||<震屏>:[PP90 pounds on Vector’s shoulders.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Honestly! I worry about you because you’re always like this!+And you came in and just stood here! Why didn’t you come say something to me!?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:The important thing is that I survived. There was no need to distract the adjutant.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:You not being around is what’s distracting!+*sighs* Vivi, we’re battlefield buddies! Have more faith in me!
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:If that’s an order, I’ll obey it.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||: If you want an order, I’ll give you one right now!+The Commander just forwarded me the full withdrawal plan, and we can set out after a short rest.+Vivi, I order you not to go off by yourself and stay with me, is that okay?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Since it’s an order, you don’t need to ask if it’s okay or not.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Alright, alright, I’ll take that as a yes.+Next, we have that human girl. What’s her story?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I met her at the base. She knows a lot about this zombie horde incident, but she’s hiding something.+However, I tested her several times along the way, so she shouldn’t be an enemy.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Mhm! I’m relieved if you say so, Vivi.

PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Vector(0)||<黑屏2>:Friend of yours, Vector?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Greetings, human girl! I’m Tactical Doll PP90, filling the role of adjutant for this operation. I’m glad to be of service!
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:……
PP90(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Vector(0)||:[Kiana stares hard at PP90’s face.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Excuse me… but is something the matter?
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Ah… it’s nothing.+I just felt that you looked a little bit like… one of my friends.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Hehe, that’s a point of pride for me as a doll.
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:However, your personalities are complete opposites…+Ah, but! You’re both very cute and I like you both very much!+I’m Kiana, very happy to meet you. I ended up being drawn into this due to some unexpected circumstances, so I’ll be in your care.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Hello, Kiana-san. Don’t worry, we’re Griffin PMC, let us take care of your safety!
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Still making a sales pitch at a time like this…+and given her skills, she should be the one protecting us, right?+...Er, what’s the matter?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector sees PP90 looking at her and laughing.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Hehe, I didn’t know you were that good at roasting people.
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:“Roas...ting?”
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:T65 taught me that term, in any case, it means you have a great sense of humor! I think I finally understand you now, thanks to all this trouble.+Ah… still, now that everything’s over, all we need to do is follow the Commander’s orders, so there’s nothing to worry about any more, right?
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Oi oi! Saying things like that is very dang-

PP90(0);Vector(0)||:
Destroyer()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ahem! Ladies of Griffin, listen up!+I’ve come all this way to tell you…+this war is about to end!
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Were you happy with that zombie horde attack just now?+Huh? What?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……？
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Ah, right. Sorry about that, ahem…+Then, were you happy with that attack of the Slain just now?+However, that attack just now was less than 10% of the forces we stocked up.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Oi! Seriously!?+All those Slain were from SF? How many more are there going to be!?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:So SF’s behind all this again? It’s kind of boring...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:I’ve waited too long for this opportunity, you Griffin villains!+You’ve been bullying me all this time, but right now, I will pay! It! All! back!
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Just for that? Then she should go settle the score with the Commander, right...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Still… my strength this time came from an accident, and the battle orders are from me, and not Mastermind-sama.+Therefore, I don’t plan to commit too many of my own units, but surely this many Slain should be enough to swamp you, right?
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:You’re looking down on us!
 ()||:[PP90 joins the public broadcast.]
BOSS-6(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Destroyer, don’t think you’re a big deal because you’ve got all those zombies! As long as you’re commanding them, I’m not scared in the least!+Our Commander is on a completely different level from idiots like you who’re underdeveloped in both their height and their brains! 
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Ha! I won’t get mad! That’s because you haven’t seen my complete form yet! A sundae head like you must have a head and stomach full of cheap ice cream!
BOSS-6(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hah!? Who are you calling a sundae head! How insulting can you get, anyway! I’ve been dieting recently and I haven’t touched any desserts!
BOSS-6(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:*quietly* It seems like the topic has subtly shifted...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:You pathetic Griffin dolls really do go to great lengths to suck up to your Commander. Puppets! Maggots!
BOSS-6(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:So what!? The Commander brings us victory and a purpose for living!+We’re not the same as you wild thugs! Hooligans! Rascals! Traitors! 
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Hehe… in other words, you can’t do anything without your Commander, can you?+Nothing wrong with that! If not for your Commander, we’d have gotten you all in your base, right?+Therefore, it’s not like I haven’t prepared for that either - do it!

BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Haha, I just cut off your communications to your HQ.+My zombie… ah no, my Slain legions reached all your communications posts long ago! And then they wrecked them all!
BOSS-6(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:But how! Destroying all our communications posts with no warning at all?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;PP90(0)||<黑屏1>:Of course it was impossible in the past, but now with so many obedient helpers I managed to carry out a battle plan which I could never have completed in the past!+In any case, you won’t be talking to your beloved Commander until you leave this sector.+It’s too late to beg for mercy or surrender now, Griffin puppets! Now prepare to taste the flames of my wrath! Hahahaha!

PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:How… could this… what… should we do now...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Huh? You can’t take action without that Commander?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:None of the dolls here has command modules of any grade…+Without the Commander’s orders… we won’t be able to come up with an effective battle plan, and we can’t mobilize so many dolls at once...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:So dolls… aren’t exactly the same as us...
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:We’re products and you’re the owners.+While you were praising us for being cute, didn’t you realize that was the reason why we were made?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:That’s enough, Vivi… its not like this was Kiana-san’s fault, was it?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Not her fault?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector laughs coldly.]
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:While I was fighting off the Slain in the warehouse, I was knocked out by an earthquake… or rather, by a tempest-like surge of energy.+You appeared after that, Kiana-san.+So, am I right to say you appeared with that energy?
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Yes, but I never intended to appear there!+I’m just a passing high-school girl, and that was just an accident!
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:If you hadn’t shown up, I could have successfully fallen back and left with the echelons long ago, but now…+you can fight your way out by yourself, but we can’t do anything but mount a scattered resistance without a commander.+What a precious gift from the heavens you are, human. It will be our honor to die for you.
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey! I’m not your enemy, Vector!
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:But you’ll be the death of us, human.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:I’m sorry, Kiana, VIvi’s just like that, please forgive her...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Vector…+Is this the real you?+You’re full of petty wisdom, but you’ve never once bothered to think about others.
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:We can die for you, but don’t think we’ll be happy to do it.
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Then what <i>have</i> you been happy to do!? You don’t even dare to frankly accept the kindness of others!+You don’t understand anyone, so how dare you conclude that I’m going to kill you all!?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Kiana-san...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Humans… dolls…+It doesn’t matter where I am, I don’t want to lose the people around me again...
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:…So are you a high school girl or a high school teacher?+I only have an hour left to live, so why don’t you think about how to survive instead of lecturing me?
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Quit jumping to conclusions and assuming I’m like that!+I’m not going to run! I’m going to stay right here!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Kiana-san, don’t be rash. However good you are, you can’t possibly wipe out all the Slain!
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:That’s right, but it would be okay if you had a commander, right?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Didn’t you hear just now? We can’t contact the Commander...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Wait. Did you just say…+Don’t tell me...
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That’s right.+Let me be your commander!
