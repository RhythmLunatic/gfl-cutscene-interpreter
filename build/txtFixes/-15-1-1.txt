Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Ohhh! Is this Griffin’s command system? Pretty interesting.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Headmistress, do you want to give it a try?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:I’ll pass, now’s not the time to play around. I’ll let you handle it.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:So she still wants to play after all...
Himeko(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Himeko enters the command room.]
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:You must be Griffin’s adjutant, ah… er...
Himeko(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hm?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Ah it’s nothing, being stared at by these girls is a little…+Sorry, I think I might have said something rude.
Himeko(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hehe, don’t worry, even in our world, a lot of humans have a hard time accepting what they see when they first look at us.+Or rather, creating this sort of first impression on others is a point of pride for us.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Haha, I’m relieved, then. Although, it seems individual dolls have completely different personalities.+I met Vector-san on the way here just now; I wanted to make conversation, but she completely shut me down...
Himeko(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Haha… sorry about that, Vivi’s been that way ever since she was rolled out of the factory. Please don’t take it to heart.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Oh, I don’t mind, but is it really alright to let her move out by herself?
Himeko(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Thank you for your concern. We’ll keep in touch with communications modules, so she’ll definitely… er… she’ll probably… call in?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Oi, Himeko, now’s not the time to chat. Don’t you have something to report?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Mm, PP90-san, do you have an electronic map of the area?+According to your observation data, a storm swept through an abandoned city about 15km away from here, several hours ago.+I think either Mei or Bronya would have touched down there.
Himeko(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, I’ll  see what I can find!+Here, right?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:This is the abandoned city. SF has taken over it now.+It’s very likely that Destroyer is based here, but we haven’t picked up any powerful SF unit signals from there for the time being.+At a closer look… there are signs that it’s been wrecked recently.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:From the extent of the destruction, it’s more likely that it’s Mei. After all, the power within her tends to go out of control very easily under those conditions...
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Then we’d better get going! At the very least we should go in and look!+If we’re any later, there’s no telling what SF will do to Mei-senpai!
Theresa(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Kiana-san, we’re going to begin attacking this city.
Theresa(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Huh? I’m coming too?
Theresa(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hehe, well, you <i>are</i> the most experienced commander here.
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Hehe, I’ll be able to see how this world fights as well!
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:Good. I’d like to see Kiana’s tactics too.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;PP90(0)||<黑屏1>:Honestly…+Looks like I’ll just have to show you how I win, then!
