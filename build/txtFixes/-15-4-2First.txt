Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:…………+That’s not enough… still not enough…+Kiana. How could an attack like that possibly kill Seele?+Can’t you hit me harder? It doesn’t hurt Seele at all~ 
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:I don’t want to kill you, Seele.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:That’s because of the other Seele, right…+Because of the other Seele who’s willing to lie in your palms and do whatever you tell her, right?+Seele just wants to take what belongs to Seele!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:You don’t take friends!+Neither Bronya or the other Seele belongs to anyone!+So please, stop hurting them!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:You’re the ones who hurt Bronya-nee, you and that world with the Breakdown in it!+If we could stay in this world, both Seele and Bronya-nee wouldn’t have to become like that again!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:The “Breakdown” is a law of our world. All we can do is survive under under those conditions.+What’s happened has happened, Seele. Neither you or Bronya can go back to the past again.

Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:……+Yes… no matter what I do, Seele and Bronya… can’t go back...
Seele(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Seele raises her weapon again.]
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:But… now Seele has a new chance to throw away that past…+To let Bronya-nee meet Seele again, and Seele will become what Bronya-nee likes…+And then… forever… and ever...
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:If you’re just trying to run from the past, then it’ll be the same no matter which world you go to!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Seele’s not running away!+Seele just wants… a fresh start!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:I’m sorry, Seele…+Then let’s put an end to it again!

FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I have to say, you sure do babble on before and after you fight.+Still, that did buy us a lot of time.
FN57(0);Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker><通讯框>||:That’s the kind of girl Kiana is. Not only does she want to win, she also wants to have the last word.+It’s reckless, but it’s also made her a lot of friends. Maybe that’s her charm point, although everyone she’s attracted is of the same sex...
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>;Himeko(0)||:Those words sound quite full of regret coming from you…+Although, have you already figured out the route, Himeko-san?
FN57(0);Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:I have a basic idea of the amusement park’s layout.+The rest is up to Mei.+Are you sure Vector and PP90 are still alive?
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>;Himeko(0)||:Frankly speaking, neither of them have much of a will to live.
FN57(0);Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:That sounds very bad.
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>;Himeko(0)||<黑屏1>:Unless…+The two of them are travelling together now...

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:…………+……Vi……vi？
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Don’t move around. Compact your body. Hang on tightly to my shoulders.+Otherwise I can’t guarantee that I can ship you back in one piece.
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I thought… I was dead...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Dolls aren’t like humans. They don’t die just because you cut through a few arteries.+Whether she intended to or not, Seele slipped up.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:But… *coughs* ...we’re still in danger, right?
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:There’s still a lot of Slain, and we might not be able to make it out in time.+Any last words? Say them, it might cheer you up.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Leave me behind...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I’ll do that for real…+Wait, are you crying?
()||:[PP90 is sobbing from where she’s hanging from Vector’s shoulders.]
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Vivi, please…+If we both die here, then this stretch of neural cloud memories will be completely destroyed…+Just when… just when we were getting along a little better.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……+You want me to live so that I can tell the next you that we were sisters in suffering for a few minutes?+I’d rather die here than confess that to someone like you who doesn’t know anything.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Haha… at least you… *cough*+..admitted that we’re friends.
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Yeah…+I honestly don’t understand why you keep pestering someone like me...
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:That’s true… you’re gloomy and curt… you’re unlikable and you love to argue.+You keep grumbling quietly to yourself, and then when you meet with the slightest setback you give up and blame everything around you...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thanks, so you were pitying me? I always hated that about you.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I was envying you, Vivi you idiot! *coughs*+I like this job very much… I like Griffin, I like the Commander, and my doll friends, but from time to time…+I’m saying, just occasionally… I guess it’s only about… 2 or 3 minutes per day… in those 2 or 3 minutes… I want to be someone like you...
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I thought everyone liked you because you were always a good girl.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Why do people have to like you because of good things?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……
()||:[Vector falls silent for a while.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thank you, PP90.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Huh？
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:And also, sorry.
()||:[PP90  laughs with difficulty from Vector’s shoulder.]
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Don’t waste the two things I want to hear the most at a time like this…+So please, just...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Forget it, we’re safe now…+Aren’t we, Mei-san?
()||:[Mei emerges from the other end of the tunnel.]
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I’m sorry, are you… alright?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:“Alright”? In this state?+Why don’t you see how much of PP90’s waist is still attached to the rest of her, and my leg.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Mei-san… how’s Seele?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Seele’s become very powerful after absorbing the Breakdown Energy… Kiana’s still buying time.+FN57-san and Headmistress Theresa are working on a plan.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||: FN57-san? Wow…+How bad are things that we need to use her plans...
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:I know you’re too badly hurt, PP90-san, so you should get a good rest first. But…+While it might not be good to talk in a place like this…+Vector-san, could I ask you to continue fighting after undergoing quick repairs?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:*laughs coldly* Sounds like I’m back to the daily grind.+What do you need?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Sorry, let me take care of the Slain in front of us first.+Excuse me-
()||:[Mei bows to Vector, then walks up to the Slain dolls and raises her weapon.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I hate to interrupt, but we can’t hold out much longer even if it’s just standing up.
芽衣()<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Headmistress Theresa will come and pick us up in person in 5 minutes.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hah, I thought a mere doll wasn’t important, particularly me.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:You’re important to me, Vivi.+At the very least, you did a good job of serving as my legs for fleeing.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I’m flattered. By the way, did you choose “fleeing” specifically because you knew what I could bear?
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hehe, that’s right… *coughs* … and I know you can bear more.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thank you. Sounds like I’m going to be much more important now.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:At the very least, Vector-san, you can’t determine how important you are by yourself.+Trust me. This time, both worlds need you.
