Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:And Mei-nee…+I’m grateful that you came, but…+You still don’t dare to strike the fatal blow to Seele, don’t you?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Seele...
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Hehe… +It’s because Himeko-san was like you that she still couldn’t stop Seele from taking Bronya away after using that Nexus.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:That’s because nobody wants to hurt you, Seele!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:What you don’t want to hurt is just Seele’s body, right?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:It’s not related to the other Seele…+Everyone just… wants to save you...
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Save me? Seele’s about to be happy in this new world…+And you? All you need to do is forget Seele and Bronya and go back before the tunnel vanishes!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Seele, you’ve brought Breakdown Energy to this world, so it’s going to end up like our world sooner or later…+It’ll break down too… so you won’t be happy.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:At least Seele will have a power that this world doesn’t have!+Nobody in this world can defeat Seele before Seele vanishes!+And nothing else… will be able to harm Bronya-nee...
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:You’re wrong, Seele.+We’ll defeat you right now...
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:You? What do you have now? Just a pack of obedient puppets!+A bunch of puppets who only know how to follow orders, just like that useless Seele! It doesn’t matter how many of those you have!
Seele(2)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Seele… did you know?+The key to our victory doesn’t lie in those Tactical Dolls.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Hehe, Seele knew, of course…+Headmistress Theresa…+you wanted to take Bronya-nee away during this time, am I right?
Seele(2);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker><通讯框>||:Huh？
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Seele noticed you from the start.+The doll echelons were just bait to buy time so you could get into the park, am I right?+While you tried to conceal your presence, it was just too strong, so Seele’s been paying attention to you all this time.
Seele(2);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:My my, I was found out?+Then it can’t be helped. My work here is done.
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Thank you, Headmistress. You came just in time.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:What?
Seele(2);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, I just came to look around, and incidentally draw your attention.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:……！
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Bronya was long since taken away by someone else…+or to be precise, some other doll.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>41</BIN>:Sorry, Seele-san. My revolting self has appeared before you again.+But don’t worry, I won’t be following you again… because it’s going to be farewell soon.
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||:Seele-san, you can’t sense dolls, can you?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker><通讯框>||:Dolls don’t have Breakdown Energy in them, and they don’t even show any regular life signs.+Vector-san was the star of this rescue from the beginning. She’s familiar with the area and skilled at operating independently.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You should be grateful for the quick repair. Also, here’s a surprise for you, Seele-san.
Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:That’s impossible. Seele can sense Bronya-nee’s still here.+You’re lying to Seele! You never took Bronya-nee away!
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker><通讯框>||:It’s true that Broyna hasn’t gone far.+She’s right beside you.

Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Bronya doesn’t want to hurt Seele.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Then join Seele and help finish off all the obstacles here…+Everything will end right away!
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Bronya had a weird dream.+Bronya saw herself, taller, with red eyes, and… a popular personality.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Sorry, I had to use a bit of psychology when waking her up-
Vector(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:The nerve of you! How dare you treat Bronya-nee that way!+You’re still… you’re still speaking of that little clown and Bronya-nee in the same breath!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Oh yes. Nauseating that I was, I still managed to do something you couldn’t.
Vector(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:What did you say?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:That was… to make Bronya-san like Seele all over again.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Bronya knew that wasn’t the real Bronya.+Bronya… could only live as Bronya.+And Seele… was Seele really living as Seele?
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:What are you saying… Bronya-nee…+Seele... is Seele, of course...
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:No.+Bronya is asking Seele.

琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<BIN>41</BIN>:Whew… that should be the end of everything, right?+What do you think, FN57-san?
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||:It’s been neatly tied up. I can bring this before FAL-san now.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Kiana, don’t get careless. We haven’t cleared up the Breakdown Energy yet.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:That’s the Headmistress’ job, isn’t it?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Hah? No way, I’m busy with a lot of things.+Did you know? This world doesn’t even know what Stigmata are!+Himeko can handle the Breakdown Energy cleanup!+<size=25>(TL Note: Homu/Stigmata are apparently a type of equipment in Houkai.)</size>
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hah… I just knew it…+Still, not today. I want to go back, take a bath and relax at Griffin’s bar.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Me too! I’ve been a commander all this time, now I want to mingle with my doll subordinates!
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||:Resting for a while is fine, but don’t take it too far.+Make sure you fix the command post before our Commander gets here.+Speaking of which, Kiana-san, how’s PP90’s condition?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker><通讯框>||:She should be able to enter the quick repair phase soon.+Vector, you’ll be able to see her soon.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Why do I have to be tied to her...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hehe, PP90 told us that.+She also told us about how you awakened Bronya and the real Seele.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:PP90 taught me about it at the last minute. When it comes to digiminds, we’ve learned through long experience.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:So you’ve got a friend who speaks the same language as you now?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:We’re just wardmates.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:In any case! Vector, you’re not allowed to not turn up for tonight’s gathering!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:*shrugs* You’re the client, so go ahead.

Kiana(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That just means PP90 knows too few dolls...
()||:[Vector crawls out of bed and takes a long yawn.]
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Also, I should be the one going “Honestly”, right? I’m waking up earlier than usual...
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey! I woke you up in person, don’t you think you ought to be saying something?
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thanks.+So, what’s next?
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:The Commander’s coming back today, so shouldn’t you be a bit more enthusiastic?
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Whatever, someone like me is…+Eh… hang on…+Kiana-san?
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:What!?
Kiana(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||: Didn’t you… already leave?

Kiana(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏2>3</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>3</黑屏1>:This is… the doll Theresa-san left behind.+Himeko-san even said that we could collect more data to perfect the rest of the dolls.
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>3</黑屏2>:Good morning, Vivi!+Kiana-san said she wouldn’t do it, but in the end she went to wake you up.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:How come even you’re calling me that now...
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Hehe, everyone’s been calling you that since that day.+So, how did you like this morning’s service?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:It was wonderful. It feels like Kiana shook apart the circuits in my head.+Couldn’t you have gotten Mei-san to wake me up instead?
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:How about having Seele-san do it next? We even managed to work out the data for that dangerous personality of hers.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Fantastic, I haven’t had nightmares in a long time.+Speaking of which, did they figure out what the weapon they tracked here was?
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:According to Theresa, it was something like a Jupiter Cannon.+But the Jupiter Cannon of this world couldn’t have done it, so it might have been us from an alternate dimension.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Then it’s none of our business. But is the Commander coming back today?
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:He’ll be back by noon. According to Theresa-san, Breakdown Energy might spread due to human observation, so he had to evacuate for a while...
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:If it was physical monsters...
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Hey, aren’t you called “vector”?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Then are you good at math? 
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Ugh… you…+I thought you’d be more straightforward in speaking after hanging around with the others for a few days.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:The others have their pleasures and I have my own.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Vivi! You’re up!
PP90(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:*sighs* Good, now there’s no “my own” any more.

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||: Vivi! Can’t you make us both look good?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I’m sorry, but the world is beautiful because it’s imperfect.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hmph! Do as you like, then!+Bronya, can you say “cheese”?
布洛妮娅()<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Is it a photo for lunch?

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Honestly, you didn’t even smile, Bronya!+And Vivi even said “cheese”...+Huh… wait, does it mean that you were smiling, Vivi?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You can say “cheese” without smiling provided you make ample use of your jaw.
布洛妮娅()<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Vivi definitely smiled just now.
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Hehe, what were we saying just now~♪
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:What? I was glad to return to the past. Isn’t that worth being happy about?
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:We can’t ever go back to the past, Vivi.

PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:All we can do is just… make the past more valuable.+All the good things, the bad things…+In the end, it’s all these things put together that make up a “world” that belongs to us.
