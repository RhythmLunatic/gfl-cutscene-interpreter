Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Seele, can you hold on?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Seele… is fine… I think!+But Vector-nee...
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||: I’ll live. Everything will be fine as long as you’re alright.+Find a way to compose yourself, like taking deep breaths, doing math, or chatting, basically anything besides stabbing me in the back!
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Uu… Seele, Seele understands!
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[The Slain are still pouring in.]
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Keep moving back, we’re almost to the surface!
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Your, your feet!
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]+[Vector suddenly senses a writhing Slain and kicks it away before putting two more rounds in it.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:……+Thank you...
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:What's wrong?
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Nothing, I’m just not used to thanking people.+If you were PP90, I’d probably have snapped at her.+Hah… I do need her reminders after all...
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:She must be… a very trustworthy friend, right?
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:She looks a lot like your Bronya-nee.+However, she’s much noisier… I’ve never managed to get along with dolls like that.+She’s nice to everyone and everyone likes her, she’s just terrible - Seele, keep backing up!
 ()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Vector brings Seele with her as they withdraw into the depths of the tunnels.]+[The Slain offensive eases off a little.]
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:You don’t like her, Vector-nee?
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I don’t like myself, I guess…+I don’t know if I should be telling her “thanks” or “sorry”...
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Seele understands…+Vector and Seele are… very similar...
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Maybe… Anyway, you’ll be gone soon, so you should just forget about it.
 ()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang! Bang bang!]
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Seele doesn’t want to go. Seele wants to find Bronya-nee and stay here forever...
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You can’t stay here. There’s nothing good about this world at all.
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:It’s better than Seele’s world…+Seele’s world doesn’t have anything...
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hm?+Don’t you have a lot of friends?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:No, Seele has nothing…+No “home”... no Bronya-nee…+Not even… Seele herself...
 ()||:[Vector freezes for a moment.]
Seele(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:What… are you saying?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Vector-nee, the way behind us is blocked.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……！
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector turns and sees that their route of escape has been completely blocked off by the ruins of a wall from above.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Well, this is fantastic...
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Vector throws up her hands in exasperation, then turns around and points her weapon at the Slain.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:It must have been the storm from before…+Sorry, Seele. I didn’t expect this route to be the death of us.
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Vector-nee… have you given up?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Sorry, but my will’s never been that strong.
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Vector-nee… don’t you want to see PP90-nee again?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I don’t know.+If you weren’t here, this might have been a good way to die.
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Seele, do you hate me?+I promised to take you to safety, but now I can’t...
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No, Seele thinks… this is good…+This is fine...
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Soon… Your wish will come true, Vector-nee...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……？
 ()||:[Vector notices that Seele seems to be laughing. Just then-]
？？()<Speaker>？？</Speaker>||:Ooooi! VIvi! Seele!+Are you there!?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:PP90, is that you?
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Vivi——!! I just knew you’d come this way!+Ah, sorry for calling you a name you don’t like...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Get us out of here first and we’ll settle things later!+Also, we’re in a lot of trouble, so don’t say you’re alone!
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I am alone, but I have explosives.+Can you back up!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:How far back? We’ve got a horde of Slain in front of us!
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Figure it out yourself, I don’t know how thick this wall is either!+Protect Seele, I’m going to set off the charges!
()||:[Beep!]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hey, wait, we haven’t-
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:[Boom!!]+……+…………
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:*coughs* PP90!+God dammit…+Seele… *coughs* Are you alright?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Seele is alright because Vector-nee protected her...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:My waist… *coughs*…+PP90! You idiot! You almost killed me!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:*coughs* Better than letting the Slain kill you!+Hurry, take my hand!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Take Seele first!
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Vector-nee, behind-
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I’ll cover you, now hurry up and get across!
()||:[With PP90’s help, Seele and Vector vault over the obstacle.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Now block up the gap! The Slain will make their way in through it!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:On it! Come help me!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:What the hell, you’re the one who -+Seele! Come help us too!
 ()||<黑屏1>:[Everyone frantically works to block up the gap.]
()||<黑屏2>:[After their narrow escape, the three of them lean against the walls and rest, bathed in the howls of the Slain from the other side of the obstacle.]
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hah… hah…+What the hell were you doing, you idiot...
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Is that how you treat your savior?
 ()||:[PP bonks Vector’s head.]
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Ow...
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Being able to feel pain means your body’s still fine.+Being so fierce just now means that you’ve still got life in you. Are you really Vec… no, Vivi?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You… you’re enjoying this, aren’t you?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Yes, I am! I’m super happy!
 ()||:[PP90 looks at Vector.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:After all… seeing you still alive...
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……+Good thing you came over in person to verify that.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Oh? Really? Then isn’t there something you should be saying to me?
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||: *shrugs* I’ll save it for next time. We’re not out of the woods yet.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Haha, I know you’re not ready.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Oh yes, I almost forgot -+You’re Seele-san, aren’t you?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:…Yes.+You’re… PP90-san, am I right?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>;Seele(0)||:Ah… yes. Do you know me?
PP90(0);Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Yes… from Vector-san, she said…+You… Vector-san said you were… a friend...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oi, Seele-
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Ah… really?+Seele, what else did Vivi say?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Vector-nee also said…+You looked a lot like Bronya-nee...
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Haha… even Bronya herself said so.+Ah, yes, Bronya-san’s already returned to the base.+We’ll bring you to see her right away, and then you can go back to your original world.
()||:[PP90 reaches a hand out to Seele.]+…………+[……But Seele doesn't respond.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Seele-san?
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:…Yes.+I’ll see her right away.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Seele……？
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:When I look closer at you, you really do look like Bronya-nee…+Not just the hairstyle, but also… the desire in your eyes, the loneliness, the wish for friends…+So much like how Bronya-nee used to be in the past...
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:What… what are you saying?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Seele, what’s with you?+Calm down, get your emotions under-
Seele(0)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:PP90-san…+How many people have you hurt up till now?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:I’m a Tactical Doll, made to serve mankind. I don’t hurt humans.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Hehe...
()||:[Seele laughs gloomily in the darkness]
希儿？()<Speaker>Seele？</Speaker>||:Hey, did you know?+While most of her body is human, Bronya-nee was once a puppet herself…+Would you like to know… what Bronya-nee’s battle records were like?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Seele? What are you talking about? Is this… relevant?
()||:
希儿？()<Speaker>Seele？</Speaker>||:That’s why I can’t stand you…+You’re using Bronya-nee’s face, but you’ve put such a disgusting smile on it.+You’ve never experienced anything, but you’re shamelessly trying to comfort others.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Seele! What’s the matter with you!?
Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:[Vector tightens her grip on her weapon.]
()||:
希儿？()<Speaker>Seele？</Speaker>||:I can’t keep pretending any more...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Huh?
希儿？()<Speaker>Seele？</Speaker>||:Seele… can’t keep pretending any more in front of someone like you…+Seele can’t keep on playing the game of being “Good Seele” any more!
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:PP90, look out-
()||<SE1>MachineGunBurst</SE1>:[Vector squeezes her trigger at Seele’s position…]+[But there’s nothing there.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:PP90！
()||:[A hideous ripping sound echoes through the tunnel.]+[Vector looks at PP90 and sees that her body has already been cut open by some sharp object.]
PP90()<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Vi……vi……+Hurry…… Run……
()||:[And then, PP90’s body slides down the wall.]
()||:[Amidst the silence, Vector hears something swinging behind her.]
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:It’s only when you lose her that you don’t mind what she thinks…+Am I right, Vector-nee?
()||<黑屏1><SE1>Rope</SE1>:[Thump.]+[Vector collapses as well.]
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||<BIN>92</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Time to say goodbye, Vector-nee.+Seele doesn’t want to play this game of house again.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:See...le…+you were… from the beginning...
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Oh, that’s right. I’ve been Seele and only Seele from start to finish.+The… the Seele from the darkness, the “Bad Seele”.+Everything since just now was just Seele pretending, as “Mama-sama” arranged. 
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Mama...sama…?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:You shouldn’t be concerned about that, right?+Also… you don’t really care about Seele, do you?+It was so hard for Seele to play that role. How could someone that useless be liked or cherished by anyone?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Then… why… did you...
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Why did I do it? Isn’t that obvious?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Seele… is a huge hole.+If it’s not filled with “love”, then not a single trace of “love” will remain…+Unless that person… unless I can pack that person in there forever and ever...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Bron… ya...
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Seele doesn’t need anything else other than Bronya-nee…+Both your world and mine are all unnecessary.+That’s what PP90 is to you, isn’t she, Vector-nee?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Of course not. You want much more than PP90 wants, don’t you, Vector-nee?+Do you want more approval? Or do you want more praise? PP90 was nothing more than a stepping stone, wasn’t she?+Seele once thought that dolls would be slightly cleaner than those humans, but in the end, you’re nothing more than the trash made by those filthy brains and hands...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Is that… what you think of us?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Trying to cover it up would only make Vector-nee that much uglier, you know.+Huh… wait a minute, you didn’t actually think Seele was trying to cheer you up earlier, did you, Vector-nee?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Don’t be ridiculous. Not laughing at you all this time was a tremendous effort for Seele.+As payback, Seele just wants to see you being eaten up in this godforsaken place.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Those… Slain...
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh yes. Seele made all of them.+But after that inferior clown pretending to be Bronya-nee showed up, Seele had a more interesting idea.+As for you… well, if you died together, would you feel worse… or… would you feel happy?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>93</BIN>:[Seele heads off into the distance, and the howling behind Vector draws ever closer.]
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Although… Seele has no interest in any answer that could be gained from your bodies.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Dammit… Seele…+You can’t… you can’t go to the base…!
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Seele… is going to fulfil her own wish.+Her sole, irreplaceable wish.+Goodbye, Vector-nee. You, your loathsome little wish and the rest of this world can all die together.
()||<黑屏1>:[Seele’s form vanishes at the end of the tunnel.]
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:……+…………[An unknown amount of time later.]
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Seele!? Seele, you’re back!?
布洛妮娅()<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Welcome back, Seele.
芽衣()<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||<黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:Seele, where are PP90 and Vector? Why didn’t they come back with you?
()||:[An unknown amount of time later.]
()||<SE1>Alarm</SE1>:……！+[Alarms ring throughout the Griffin base.]
德丽莎()<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Hurry, get after her!+Himeko, use “that”, we’re out of time!
姬子()<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:Here!?
德丽莎()<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Any later and Seele’s going to wreck this base!+Hurry!
()||:……
芽衣()<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Bronya——！！
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>93</BIN><震屏><黑屏2>:……！
()||:[The howling behind her wakes Vector up.]+[The Slain dolls have broken through the barricade and have crawled up behind her.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:PP… 90…+There’s something… I haven’t been able to tell you all this time…+Today… Really was the worst day of my life…+But if I hadn’t known you so well, then maybe I would have just died normally instead.
()||<黑屏1>:[Vector fights the pain and struggles to her feet.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Right now…+I’ve got no choice but to live on… For you.
