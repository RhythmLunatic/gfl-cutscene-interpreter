FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||:Honestly.+How did you let things end up like this?+I only left this to you because PP90 vouched for you.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey, it’s not like I wanted this to happen!+Who could have known Seele was actually...
FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:There wouldn’t have been any problems if you had just killed her off, right?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:I’m sorry, 57-san, but Seele is our friend, after all...
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Your friend? Is the definition of friend in your world someone that you fight with all day and who then proceeds to wreck someone else’s home?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:To some extent… yes.
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Sounds just like the protagonist of a TV series.+And now things have ended up like this after spending all those resources, and by the time our Commander comes back we’ll have to wreck it all anyway…+Then, the main loss now was this… Ponya-san, I believe?
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:It’s Bronya!
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Tch, Eastern Europeans.+In any case, she’s the human girl with the same sundae hairstyle as PP90, right?. 
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Seele kidnapped her, and now we want to get her back.+And also… we want to bring Seele back safely too...
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:You can bring that big mess anywhere you want as long as it’s not here.+Also, please get rid of the Breakdown Energy you brought along and get rid of all those zombie dolls too. 
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Mm! We’ll take care of it!
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:So our aims are the same, then?+In that case, I’ll be your adjutant this time, but don’t expect me to coddle you like PP90 did.
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Huh? Really?
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Well, we’ve settled things on our side and Helian-san approved it too.+After all, our dolls caused some trouble in your world, so consider this working together as equals.+Also, there needs to be a Griffin doll supervising you in case you hit the self-destruct button or something.
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Is there really such a thing...
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Someone’s definitely used it before.+Also, where are our PP90 and Vector?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:I’ve been worrying about that myself. If Seele came back alone, then they...
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:I’ve just detected a Griffin signal. Not sure who it belongs to, but things are looking pretty grim where they are.+Who’s willing to go out and get them?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Himeko-san! You’re okay already?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Mm, just that the Nexus System took a lot out of me. I might not be able to directly participate in the upcoming battles.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Then let me go and find them. You should stay here and assist Kiana, Himeko-san.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:What, you’re making me sound so unreliable…+Speaking of which, where’s Headmistress Theresa?
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker><通讯框>||:I’m repairing Griffin’s databases.+That Seele… I don’t know what she was up to when she was messing around with them…+Still, this is fine. I’ve found her location after examining the traces she left behind.
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Really?
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:She’s right beside us, in that ruined amusement park.+While I have no idea what Seele’s brought Bronya there for, we just need to take her back ASAP.+Also, there’s another problem; according to an observation report just now, the passage might end up closing soon.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>;Theresa(0)||:Huh? What does that mean? We… can’t go back?
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Ahh… actually there’s a few more days, but you’d better not delay for too long!
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:“Don’t delay for too long”, you could settle this quickly enough if you stepped in, Headmistress!
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Forget it, Seele’s caused so much trouble that I’m afraid I might thoroughly destroy her if I got careless.+So I’m handing her over to you-
RaidenMei(0);Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, then everything should be fine now, right? Let’s begin right now!
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker><通讯框>||:Are you <i>sure</i> everything is fine?
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Huh? What’s the matter?
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Are you just going to openly march our forces in?+Leaving aside the number of casualties that Seele is going to cause to our dolls, given that she can chop the base in half…+Your Bronya’s still in her hands. Are you sure you can rescue the hostage that way?
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Then… then what should I do?
RaidenMei(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Stall for time until Mei finds Vector and PP90.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:…I understand what FN57-san’s getting at.
Himeko(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>FN-57</Speaker>||:Hehe, that’s Himeko-san the soldier for you.+Let’s discuss the specifics of the plan later!

Himeko(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh? What are you guys going on about over there…+Alright, alright, I’ll do it your way!+Besides, all I need to do is stall Seele, right!?

Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:……+Seele.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Are you awake, Bronya-nee?+Did you dream of Seele?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Bronya hasn’t dreamt in a long time.+All this was done by you, Seele.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Yup. Seele heard the voice of “Mama-sama”.+By the time I woke up, I was sitting inside the Hyperion.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:While the mothership was passing through the tunnel, Seele took over the original Seele’s body.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Yup, the original Seele... so weak and useless that everyone couldn’t like her more.+Seele simply took back what was hers.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:And the one who sabotaged the mothership back then was...
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Was also Seele, at Mama-sama’s suggestion.+The storm outside was fierce, so all I needed to do was open a cabin door.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:……+And the Headmistress mentioned that this world didn’t originally have Breakdown Energy...
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:That’s obvious, how could this world have Breakdown Energy?+Obviously it was Seele who dumped it out of the mothership during the confusion-
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:And you did all this… for Bronya?
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Of course it was for Bronya-nee. It was all for… this moment.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Bronya… isn’t worth that much.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:That’s because you forgot, Bronya-nee. You’ve forgotten too much…+But that’s fine, Bronya-nee. From today onwards, you can stay in this world with Seele <i>forever</i>.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Here?
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:There’s no Breakdown here, no Slain, and no “Mama-sama”...+So Seele doesn’t have to hurt anyone any more, and Bronya-nee doesn’t have to be hurt any more…+I’m sure we can be very very happy here!
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:This place doesn’t belong to us.+It doesn’t belong to Bronya, and it doesn’t belong to Seele eith-
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Then what belongs to Seele!?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:……
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Bronya-nee, you should know… Seele doesn’t have anything anymore…+Right now, I don’t even need to protect that useless Seele… was Seele wrong?+Is that what you think too, Bronya-nee? That your friends on the Hyperion are more important than Seele?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Seele is very important.+But two people can’t live by themselves in this place.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:That’s fine! Seele’s already prepared!
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Seele takes out a storage device.]
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:I saved all the doll personality data from that Griffin database in here.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Why did you steal that?
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:To make Bronya-nee happy, of course.+With a slight conversion, Seele can change to the personality of any doll.+Do you understand now?  As long as Bronya-nee likes it, Seele can become anybody!
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:What does Seele mean by “like”?
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Bronya-nee, are you examining Seele’s status?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Seele’s status is very unstable.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:That’s the price Seele has to pay for staying here…+Seele is willing to do anything for Bronya-nee. That’s what “liking” means to Seele.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:But Bronya doesn’t know how to respond.+Bronya can’t do anything for Seele...
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Seele knows, Seele knows…+Seele knows that it was because of Seele… That Bronya-nee can’t go back to how she used to be…+But Seele will do anything to make Bronya-nee like Seele again.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Seele…+If that happens, your mind will become even more unstable, and then it’ll vanish again.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Yes…+To Seele right now, “forever” is a temporary thing…+So can’t you keep Seele company a while longer, Bronya-nee? Or...
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:[Seele takes Bronya’s hand.]
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Would you rather Seele vanish now…+Again… for ever...
Bronya(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Seele(2)||:[Bronya lets go of Seele’s hand.]
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Bronya doesn’t want to hurt anyone else any more.+Also, everyone will come looking for Bronya.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:You won’t have to worry about that, Bronya-nee.+Seele will take good care of Bronya-nee.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>;Seele(2)||:Seele, you shouldn’t hurt them.
Bronya(0);Seele(2)<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:I’m sorry, Bronya-nee.+What Seele wants can only be gained by hurting others.
