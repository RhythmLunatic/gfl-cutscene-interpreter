BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Come on! Keep coming!+Hahahaha! How could an attack of that scale possibly defeat me?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Her complete form… It’s bigger than the rumors said!
PP90(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:She’s still emitting Breakdown Energy! We need to keep attacking!+Just hold on a little longer and we’ll deplete her Breakdown Energy soon!
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Deplete? You underestimate me at your peril!
()||<震屏><SE1>Explode</SE1>:[Destroyer waves her hand and the dolls are scattered by a wave of Breakdown Energy.]
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Uwah! She’s too strong! Everyone, get down!
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:I’ve got more than enough time to deal with all of you before I run out!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:That’s enough, Destroyer.+Stop abusing our world’s power for evil deeds!
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:…You’ve finally come, Mei-san.+Didn’t you give me this power?+And now you can’t take it back. You can’t do anything!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:I know that there are many things I can’t take back…+But I’ll do my best to make up for them, while there’s still time...
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||:Look out, Mei-san! She’s very dangerous!
()||:[Mei braves the storm of Breakdown Energy to walk up to Destroyer.]
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Hmph, so you’re planning to get rid of me?+You plan to kill me because the power I’ve gained is no longer under the control of you humans, right?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:I don’t fight in order to kill.
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Then you’re doing it because you regret what you did, right?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:……
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Be careful, Mei-senpai! Breakdown Energy’s rapidly accumulating around her!
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Oh yes, do be careful!+If I release all this power at once, there’s no telling if it really will kill you! Ahahahaha!
()||:[Mei draws her katana.]
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hey, senpai, are you going all-out?+If you get serious here, you’re going to wreck the surroundings!
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:But if I back down here… then it’ll all be meaningless.+Come, let’s finish this——！
BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:As you wish!
()||<震屏><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:[Shing!]+…………
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:[Destroyer collapses, and the Breakdown energy begins to safely disperse.]
芽衣()<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Huh…+But how...
()||<黑屏1>:[But Mei did not swing her weapon.]+…………
Bronya(0)<Speaker>？？</Speaker>||<BIN>41</BIN><BGM>GF_xBH2_Menu</BGM><黑屏2>:Bronya, reporting mission accomplished.
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:B-Bronya!+Are, are you alright?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Where did you go? Why did you only come out now?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Bronya has been hiding by Destroyer’s side all this time, waiting for a chance.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:All this time…? So you waited until just now?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Did Bronya help?
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:Mm… you helped a lot. Thank you, Bronya!
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Huh? Are things over on this side?
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:Bronya came back too. Well done.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:How come you only just came back? What were you doing just now?
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Ah? Nothing, just strolling around...
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:The headmistress was swapping information with some Griffin higher-ups…+And at the same time, she borrowed IOP’s technology to make a Kiana doll.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:……+Headmistress, didn’t we agree not to interfere too much with this world?+Also? Why me? That, that sounds very weird!
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:Aw, it’s just a one-time technical collaboration between senior staff.+Although, it’s really quite magical; just entering the data I collected over time was enough to produce a doll!+It’s amazing, it’s just like the real Kiana! Even her sleeping face was faithfully replicated...
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Oi! Enough about that!+While we were risking our lives to stop the enemy, you were messing around at Griffin with my private information!
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Theresa</Speaker>||:It’s not just Kiana either, we made some for the others too!+Although, it’ll take some time. We’ll need to slowly collect combat and regular lifestyle data for them!
Theresa(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hah! You’re talking like everyone’s interested in them. Are you going to make a Mei-senpai doll for Bronya?+Oh yeah, how about a tailor-made male doll for Himeko-san?
Bronya(0)<Speaker>Bronya</Speaker>||:Bronya only wants the real thing.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Himeko</Speaker>||:Sadly, IOP declined the order I made.
Himeko(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:So you did think about those things too…+I, I guess it can’t be helped. I’ll go take a look if I have the chance.
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Mei</Speaker>||:You clearly want to see them too...
RaidenMei(0)<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||:Hmph! In any case, it’s all settled!+PP90, take everyone home! Now all we need to do is wait for Vector to bring Seele back.
琪亚娜()<Speaker>Kiana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:PP90? What’s wrong?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP90</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏1>:…………+Vivi…+Her comms signal… it vanished...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:…………+[At the same time, in a certain abandoned underground railway tunnel.]+[Vector and Seele are carefully advancing by a dim light.]
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:…Are we there yet?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Shh… please be quiet.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:I’m sorry… it’s too dark here, I’m a little scared...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hold my hand.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Your hands are... holding your weapon...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oh, then hold on to my clothes.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Your skirt… is a little short.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oh, it’s a combat miniskirt.+Then stay close to me.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:It’s okay… Seele can bear with this.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Sorry, I’m a Tactical Doll; a lot of my design elements aren’t very appealing to others.+Same goes for my personality.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:It’s okay… Seele doesn’t hate you.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Thank you. Don’t worry, I’m only responsible for finishing the job.+As long as there’s a job, I’ll make sure I complete it well.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Mm. Seele isn’t worried.+Will we… be there soon?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:We should be, but I don’t know exactly how far away we are.+Being underground impedes our transmissions and I can’t pinpoint our location.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Why did we go underground all of a sudden?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:We need to avoid the zones where the Slain are active.+As you just saw, the Slain on the surface suddenly went berserk all at once, and it’s very unsafe.+It’s very likely that… the enemy ringleader was defeated by Kiana and PP90.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:The enemy… ringleader?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:They’re our enemy. They’re not related to you.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:But the Slain... are related to us.+When Seele and the others came here, we got you involved too.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:……+Perhaps…+And once there’s a relationship, it might end up being unshakeable...
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Hm?
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Just some worthless grumbling, don’t worry about it.+Speaking of which, is Bronya-san a friend of yours?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Bronya-san and Seele… are best friends.
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Do you make things difficult for each other? Do you settle your problems?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Bronya-nee never makes mistakes.+It’s always Seele who’s wrong...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Is that all?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait…+What, what’s that noise? Vector-nee!
()||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:[A series of low moans chorus out from behind them.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oi, no way...
()||:[The figures visible in the distant lights are a horde of shambling Slain dolls.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:The Slain… What are the Slain doing here!?
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:Vector-nee… I… I’m scared...
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Don’t be afraid. I can handle an attack of this scale.+Get behind me, hurry!
()||<SE1>Gunkill</SE1>:……[Bang bang!]+[Vector takes aim at the leading Slain and advances while shooting.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:It’s as though they knew they were here…+Seele, keep yourself under control, don’t let that persona out!
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:But… if my other persona comes out, Seele can destroy all of them!
()||:[Vector pats Seele on the shoulder.]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I made a promise to a friend that I’d bring you back safely… trust me, I’ll take care of it.
希儿()<Speaker>Seele</Speaker>||:…Mm.+Seele will… hang in there!
()||<SE1>Gunkill</SE1>:[Bang bang!]
Vector()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What a wonderful day…+How much more trouble must I go through before I can return to how things were…+Or could it be that I can never go back?
