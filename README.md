# gfl-cutscene-interpreter
Girls' Frontline Cutscene Interpreter. Watch GFL cutscenes right in your browser.

In action: http://gfl.amaryllisworks.pw

# BUGS
- Phaser cannot restart, a scene has to be used.
- Sometimes the text interpreter screws up.
- The UI for picking a chapter is... Horrible.

# HOW DO I USE???
First, dump all the game data.
Then put avgtxt and avgtexture in the same folder.

Then host a webserver. 

For debugging: `python3 -m http.server`, then go to http://localhost:8080 in your internet browser
